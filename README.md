# Tile_Puzzle
Tile Puzzle is a simple puzzle game written with PyGame.

Sort all numbers according to their value and leave the bottom right field blank to win.

Tiles can be moved with the arrow key's. I'm working on mouse control :)

# TODO
- show a graphical effect after a tile was moved on its right position
- rearange the code (outsource to different files)
- variable field size (3x3, 4x4, 5x5, 6x6)
- support control with mouse
- implement a highscorelist

# Features
- puzzle game for a 4x4 field
- menu to play and exit the game
- linear animation for moving tiles around
