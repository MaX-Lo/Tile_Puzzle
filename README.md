# Tile_Puzzle
Tile Puzzle is a simple puzzle game written with PyGame.

Sort all numbers according to their value and leave the bottom right field blank to win.

Tiles can be moved with the arrow key's. I'm working on mouse control :)

- tremble animation when trying to move a not existing tile

# TODO
